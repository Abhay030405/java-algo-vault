# java-algo-vault

A curated vault of essential Data Structures & Algorithms problems solved in Java.

This repository contains handpicked questions that are either:
- Frequently asked in technical interviews (FAANG, HFT, etc.)
- Crucial for mastering a concept or pattern
- Personally challenging and worth revisiting

Each solution is written for clarity, performance, and learning — with the goal of building a long-term, reusable knowledge base.

### 💡 Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Sliding Window, Two Pointers, and more...

### 📌 Why this repo?
> Not just for solving — but for remembering.

This repo acts as my **algo vault**: a personal collection of “must-know” problems I want to revisit before any major interview or project.
